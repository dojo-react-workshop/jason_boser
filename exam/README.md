# Final Exam

Welcome to the exam! Go ahead and **fork** this repository to your personal Github account.

This exam is to be completed in two parts:

1. A short answer/algorithm section meant to assess your knowledge of JavaScript and React concepts. That can be found [here](./written_test.md). You should spend no more than **40** minutes on this section before committing your answers using the message `completes written portion`.

2. A small React application (the skeleton is already set up [here](./src/App.js)) that interacts with the Github API. The wireframe can be found [here](./github_exam.png). A grading rubric can be found [here](./app-details.md).

Please remember to commit your code (don't push it until you're completely done) at the following milestones:

1. `completes written portion`
2. `completes static version`
3. `completes app`
